iTextSharpLGPL-Monotouch

This project is taking the last version of the iTextSharp that was licenced with LGPL, putting it 
in an iOS Library Project, adding a reference to monotouch, adding in a Mono System.Drawing.dll 
from the Mono sysdrawing-coregraphics project, and making a few minor tweaks to get it working.

Changes to code:
- Added setter to the Chunk Content
- Removed Barcode files
- Removed an optimization in the ECFieldElement sqrt() function
- Commented out line 623 in LinearGradientBrush in Mono's sysdrawing-coregraphics.
